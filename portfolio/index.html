                    I am a Junior at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire studying Graphic Communications. I am from Pewaukee Wi and have had a passion for photography for as long as I can remember. Post graduation I will be pursuing a career in graphic design doing product design for companies.  I took photos for the Spectator UWEC Newspaper for a couple of months my freshman year. From there I continued taking headshots and experimenting with creative photography. I love doing wildlife and landscape photography by recently have been working on human subjects.
